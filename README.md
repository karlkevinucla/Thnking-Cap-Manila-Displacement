# Thnking-Cap-Manila-Displacement
This website contains data on drivers of displacement in the capital city of Manila. 

## Summary 
Manila is going through an unprecedented infrastructure boom that has adverse impacts on already vulnerable communities. With over 12.8 million people living in 239 square miles, it is one of the most dense urban areas in the world. Recently, foreign investment has entered the country and and exacerbated the displacement of low-income communities through gentrification in addition to other causes of displacement due to nature. It's important to look at how foreign investment can encourage more protection for these already vulnerable groups. In addition to this, it is important to identify areas of the city where large agglomerations of low-income groups are settling into and how vulnerable they are to the climate crisis.

The graphic output from this website shows important information on what areas are experiencing displacement, by natural disaster, infrastructure building, gentrification driven by foreign investment and a real estate boom. The map functions in a way similar to census tract groups in the United States and color codes parts of the city that are experiencing displacement issues. The data was collected by UCLA and UC Berkeley urban planning students. The information is also interactive and can be viewed by looking at specific drivers of displacement. I think given all of this information, this might have been compiled using ESRI-based GIS. It works because it is interactive and easily identifies areas of the city that are susceptible to displacement. This information can be used when considering new policies to address displacement in the city.
